# Attention for Histone Modification
In this repository, we implement an deep-learning attention model that is used to predict cell-type activity in histone modifications. 

## Progress
In this section, we detail the progress of the project.

### Milestone 0: Layout the network architecture of the model
### Milestone 1: Add deep learning model (Keras)
### Milestone 2: Add deep learning model (Tensorflow -- optional)
### Milestone 3: Add training script
### Milestone 4: Evaluate model
