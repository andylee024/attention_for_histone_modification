# Komorebi
Komorebi is a general machine learning platform that interfaces with common frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras. The platform provides interfaces for critical parts of a machine learning pipeline (dataset generation, model specification, model training). This was created for a collaboration that I had with the [Neurogenomics Laboratory](http://www.pfenninglab.org/) at CMU, where we developed this pipeline to do machine learning for understanding the epigenetics of Alzheimer's Disease. 

## About this project
I've written about this project extensively in the following [blog post (https://andylee024.github.io/blog/2017/10/10/ml_infrastructure/). 

## Design Philosophy
The design philosophy is to modularize machine learning to iterate faster. In japanese, komorebi means sunlight through the trees. In our context, statistical insights represent sunlight and the data represents trees.
