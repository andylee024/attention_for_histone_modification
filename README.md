# Komorebi
Komorebi is a general machine learning platform that interfaces with common frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras. The platform provides interfaces for 3 critical parts of a machine learning pipeline

1. **Dataset Generation** 
2. **Model Specification**
3. **Model Training**

The design philosophy is to modularize machine learning to iterate faster. In japanese, komorebi means sunlight through the trees. In our context, statistical insights represent sunlight and the data represents trees.
