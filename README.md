# Attention for Histone Modification
In this repository, we implement an deep-learning attention model that is used to predict cell-type activity in histone modifications. 

## Progress
The [Attention Progress Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jbcxc8zcNPKMT17TuPbZVQDw7wNN1bQMUkOk7mi7xVQ/edit) tracks current progress on the project. It also contains some design notes about how the software will be implemented.
